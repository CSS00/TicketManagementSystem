```

### Authentication

All secured endpoints require a **JWT token**.  
Use the `/api/auth/login` to authenticate and receive a token. You can use these pre-created accounts below, or got to `/api/user/register` to register a new regular user.
Copy the token and click the **Authorize** button in Swagger, then paste the token in the pop-up window.
```
Admin
{
  "email":"sl@gmail.com",
  "password":"67890"
}

Regular user
{
  "email":"abc@gmail.com",
  "password":"12345"
